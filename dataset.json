    "input": "Knowledge Base Preparation. GaussMaster aggregates multisource GaussDB documents into a unified knowledge base, splitting text by semantic boundaries (e.g., the code block including GaussDB SQLs), retaining structural elements (e.g., the hierarchical titles in markdown files), and removing duplicates. Each chunk is augmented with version tags and neighboring context. Additionally, GaussMaster wraps DBMind’s 25 diagnostic tools under a RESTful interface and codifies expert workflows into anomaly diagnosis trees, improving the troubleshooting stability of LLMs. LLM-based Question Pre-processing. When a user raises a natural language question, GaussMaster first performs two steps of pre-processing: (1) Hybrid Question Decomposition: the question is decomposed into finer-grained sub-queries (e.g., smaller semantic chunks or tool-invocation hints) via both rule-based and LLM methods. (2) Intent-Aware Prompt Assignment: Based on the question’s content and intent, GaussMaster automatically routes by prompting LLMs the question into either the LLM-based Q&A module (including the code copilot functionality like code review and optimization) or the LLM-based Diagnosis & Repair module (if it detects an anomaly-related or troubleshooting intent). LLM-based Q&A. We provide three main functions: (1) Risk checking mechanism with both a sensitive word detector and a semanticbased content classifier. Once the preprocessed questions are considered to be risky, GaussMaster returns a pre-defined refusal response to users; (2) Hybrid knowledge retrieval for matching the most relevant information (from sources like the development guide and the FAQ textbook) to answer the question. We fine-tune an embedding model and a re-ranking model over the GaussDB corpus with 106,810 samples by expanding the input question set through rule-based synonym substitution and LLM-based question rephrasing. The retrieved information is utilized to generate high-quality answers; (3) The generated answer goes through the same risk checking mechanism to ensure safety before responding to users. LLM-based Diagnosis & Repair. We call the module given the description of triggered alerts, which supports four main functions: (1) Identify the correct tools through hybrid retrieval and re-ranking based on user question and tool usage descriptions; (2) Multi-step strategy to fill in the corresponding parameters by analyzing user questions and asking for the complement of absent ones from users; (3) Retrieve the relevant historical alarm cases and diagnosis tree (i.e., the sequence of troubleshooting steps by GaussDB experts) for the subsequent diagnosis; (4) Conduct diagnosis-tree-guided orchestration using multiple tools, combined with a multi-agent diagnosis approach that includes expert assignment, task decomposition, and self-reflection [12].",

    "input": "Transport models are used to extract information about the nuclear Equation of State (EoS) (see [1] and Refs. therein) from heavy-ion collision data. Results from extensive studies performed with the BoltzmannUehling-Uhlenbeck model (BUU), the Quantum Molecular Dynamics model (QMD), and the Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics Model (AMD) can be found in the literature [1–3]. These models solve nuclear transport equations governed by interaction terms connected to the EoS. The results of their simulations are compared with those of experimentally measured observables to infer the EoS and other transport properties used as input parameters. More recently, the study of the N/Z-asymmetry dependence of the EoS has become increasingly important because of their potential implications on the interior of neutron stars (see [4] and Refs. therein). The accelerator facilities providing beams with ranges of neutron-proton asymmetries and transport simulations have therefore provided tools to study nuclear matter of astrophysical relevance under laboratory-controlled conditions. Understanding the complex dynamics of heavy-ion collisions calls, in particular, for a theoretical and experimental treatment of observables that test the space-time features of the collision process. Particle-particle correlations have been extensively used [5, 6], and the mentioned transport theory provides a framework for understanding what they may reveal. In this manuscript, we use the pBUU transport approach, developed by Danielewicz and Bertsch [7], describing the time evolution of a single-particle phase-space distribution and nucleon-nucleon collisions [1, 5, 8]. Particles follow classical trajectories under the influence of a mean-field potential and nucleon-nucleon collisions. The phenomenological at its root model requires several parameters for the scattering cross-section and mean field, and elementary data, heavy-ion collision data, and theoretical considerations constrain their variability range, with EoS implications. The quantity linking pBUU and other BUU models [5, 9] with the correlation data is the so-called twoparticle source function S(r), that is the probability density of emitting a pair of particles, usually protons, at a relative distance r at the time when the second particle is emitted. Following the so-called Koonin-Pratt equation [10–12], one can fold the square of a final-state wave function calculated theoretically with the source from transport to arrive at a correlation function to be compared with the data. Since BUU involves several adjustable parameters, one can likely learn correlation function data by comparing the source function obtained from BUU with the one obtained from imaging methods [6]. Recently, a new imaging approach called ”deblurring” has been introduced in Refs. [13–15]. The parameters yielding the source function better conforming with the outcomes of imaging and deblurring approaches can be used to constrain the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and other important transport properties. In particular in Ref. [5], the source function calculated with BUU simulations was compared to the sources imaged from experimental correlation functions. The two-proton correlation was found to be sensitive to the details of the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross-section, σNN . Moreover, in Ref. [16], a transport model was used to study the effects of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy on two-nucleon (pp, np and nn) correlations in heavy-ion collisions. Indeed, the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy affects nucleon emission times at the early stage of the collision and, consequently, the space-time extent of their emitting sources. The conclusions of the article point to the possibility of using two-nucleon correlations as a tool to probe the symmetry energy. A similar analysis with the same model showed that including momentum-dependent interactions may reduce the sensitivity of two-nucleon correlations to the density dependence of the symmetry energy [16]. A quantitative pursuit of the symmetry energy with correlations thus requires the study of multiple observables that can also constrain the details of momentum-dependent interactions.",
    "expected_output": "The study leverages transport models like BUU to investigate the nuclear equation of state (EoS) using heavy-ion collisions. It focuses on how two-nucleon correlations, derived from both simulations and imaging techniques, can probe symmetry energy and nucleon interactions. The pBUU framework and “deblurring” imaging are used to refine parameter estimates. Findings suggest that momentum-dependent interactions influence correlation sensitivity, requiring multiple observables for accurate EoS constraints."

    "input": "Accurate prediction of molecular properties is fundamental to advancements in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science, and has significant implications in healthcare, particularly in personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics [1, 2, 3]. Complexity in data and decision-making is a significant challenge in both molecular classification and healthcare settings [4, 5, 6, 7]. Understanding and managing complexity through appropriate models and cognitive strategies is crucial for effective decision support system design. Employing heuristics can aid in managing complex decision tasks, both in clinical settings and computational models [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Similar to the challenges encountered in molecular classification, healthcare applications often struggle with processing unstructured and high-dimensional data, especially in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) [13, 14, 15, 16]. These methods, including AI-driven visualizations and decision-support systems, enhance clinical workflow efficiency and decision-making [9, 13, 14, 17, 18], a concept that resonates with ongoing efforts to integrate quantum mechanical insights into classical molecular analysis. Advancements in AI have also led to the development of AI-powered smartphone applications aimed at facilitating medication adherence through improved communication of medication information [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Moreover, integrating blockchain technology with AI can enable secure sharing of healthcare data among providers, enhancing data accessibility while safeguarding privacy [20, 25, 26, 27]. Educational tools utilizing augmented reality and AI, such as PGxKnow, have been developed to bridge gaps in pharmacogenomics education, further highlighting the potential of integrating advanced technologies in healthcare and molecular sciences [28, 29, 30, 31]. Addressing health disparities in digital health technology design is crucial to ensure that advancements in AI and quantum computing benefit diverse populations without exacerbating existing inequalities [1, 19, 20, 27, 32]. Furthermore, in the context of pandemics such as COVID19, AI and molecular classification play a vital role in identifying infection mechanisms and potential drug targets [1, 33]. Integrating classical molecular dynamics (MD) with quantum concepts enhances our understanding of protein structures and dynamics. This study uniquely combines classical MD and quantum approaches to examine structural behaviors and interactions among APP, Tau, and Alpha-synuclein. By identifying residue-level contacts—such as electrostatic hotspots between APP and Alpha-synuclein and Tau's transient β-strand formation—we offer insights to guide therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative aggregation.",
    "expected_output": "This paper explores the intersection of molecular property prediction and healthcare through AI, emphasizing challenges in handling complex, high-dimensional data. It highlights the role of heuristics, AI-driven decision-support systems, and secure data sharing via blockchain in clinical settings. Advanced tools such as AR and AI-powered apps are used to enhance education and medication adherence. The integration of quantum concepts with classical molecular analysis supports drug discovery and treatment design for neurodegenerative diseases."
